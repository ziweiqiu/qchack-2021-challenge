# Compiling Quantum Circuits onto NISQ Devices
### Submission to the Google Challenge in QCHACK2021 (https://www.qchack.io/)



#### Ziwei Qiu (ziweiqiu@g.harvard.edu)

This challenge aims to realize universal compilation of a unitary matrix to the quantum gates that can be executed on practical quantum hardware, in particular the Google Sycamore device. Limited types of single- and two-qubit gates are allowed and not all qubits are connected. Here is the link with more details:
