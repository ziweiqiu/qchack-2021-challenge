# Compiling Quantum Circuits to NISQ Devices
### Submission to the Google Challenge in QCHACK2021 (https://www.qchack.io/)



#### Ziwei Qiu (ziweiqiu@g.harvard.edu)

This challenge aims to realize universal compilation of arbitrary multi-qubit quantum operations to the gates supported on practical quantum hardware, in particular the Google Sycamore device. Only limited types of single- and two-qubit gates are allowed and not all qubits are connected.
